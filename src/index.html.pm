◊em{"In any case,
the things you thought you ought to do, well..
you should work to see them through til the end. And whatever the result might be,

If you feel you did all you could then that’s enough.
Don’t concern yourself with what others say- because isn’t that fine?
Don’t you think? Because in the end, it’s about you.
Don’t you agree?"}
