         <root><h3>software dev reflections</h3>

I won't dwell on the technical details of the course, you can read it <em>here</em>.

<br/><br/>

In many ways, this course forced me to mature as a human being. Many times in my academic career,
I would rely on the forgiveness of my teachers and TAs to help me.

<br/><br/>

This course was the first time in my life that I had doubted my capabilites, <em>significantly</em>.

<br/><br/>

I remember on my birthday, there was this incredibly hard milestone due within 48 hours. I never celebrated
my birthday, instead I was cooped up with my partner in the depths of hayden hall, puzzled at the homework
specification.

<br/><br/>

I remember the times when I went up in front of the class, prepared to show off the code I had so painstakingly
designed and written over hours of hardwork, only to get ripped to shreds by the professor. Forced to redesign
and think about a new approach to the problem.

<br/><br/>

I remember working so late into the night, realizing that I hadn't eaten the entire day. No shops were open,
the streets were quiet, and the air felt frigid when I left the building.

<br/><br/>

But...

<br/><br/>

I remember laughing with my partner those late nights. Joking about why we were taking this class and how our
lives would be so much simpler if we hadn't

<br/><br/>

I remember submitting the final milestone, hugging my classmates and partners, just relieved that it was all done.

<br/><br/>

I remember the final code walk, where I slurred my words and trembled in front of the professor. Going over code that
I hadn't practiced before. I received the highest score I had ever received in a code walk, an 8/10.

<br/><br/>
I remember many things about this class, and will continue to remember them for a long time.
